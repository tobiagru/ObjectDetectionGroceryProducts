# Object Detection Datasets in the Grocery Product Domain
This is a collection of datasets which are useful for object detection in the domain of grocery product detection. The credits for the respective datasets belong to the authors, which are credited with each dataset individually. These datasets were accumulated by the [Auto-ID Labs](https://www.autoidlabs.ch/) at the [ETH Zürich](www.ethz.ch) within an ongoing effort to accelerate computer vision research in the grocery domain. The datasets were accumulated by Klaus Fuchs & Tobias Grundmann.

### Holoselecta
*Klaus Fuchs, Tobias Grundmann, Elgar Fleisch; Towards Identification of Packaged Products via Computer Vision; 2019; Proceedings of the IoT 2019*  

A dataset of labeled bounding boxes on realistic images of products in vending machines of the Zurich area.

### Grocery Products (GroZi101)
*Alessio Tonioni, Luigi di Stefano; Domain invariant hierarchical embedding for grocery products recognition; 2019; Computer Vision and Image Understanding*  

A dataset of labeled products in Swiss supermarket shelves. This dataset is a task-adaption one-shot learning dataset. For every product there is one labeled studio quality image of the product in the training dataset and the validation dataset consists of labeled bounding boxes in shelves in a shop realistic environment.
